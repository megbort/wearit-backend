# WearIt Backend

Welcome to the WearIt Backend! The GraphQL API powering the wearit front-end project built with Next.js.

This backend service provides a robust GraphQL API using Apollo Server and TypeScript, designed to support the modern WearIt shopping experience. As part of the second iteration of this project, we're implementing scalable architecture patterns and modern development practices.

This API will handle product catalogs, user management, shopping cart functionality, and order processing for the WearIt platform. Expect continuous improvements and feature additions as we build out the complete e-commerce experience! 🛍️
